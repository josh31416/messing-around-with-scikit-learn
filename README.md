# Messing around with ScikitLearn

Here you will find code examples exploring some UCI machine learning datasets and building models with ScikitLearn.
I intend to move these to jupyter notebooks in the future, but for now, python scripts with inline comments are available.

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/josh31416/messing_around_with_scikit_learn.git
cd messing_around_with_scikit_learn
python3 <<path_to_python_script>>
```

Optionally, you could execute the scripts in the PyCharm IDE which is what I used.
